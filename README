Dissent Library and Applications for Provable Anonymous Communication

Overview
===============================================================================
This library will eventually provide a framework for constructing provably
anonymous overlays with the following key features.

The library requires Qt and CryptoPP and can be built using qmake on
dissent.pro (qmake dissent.pro)

While previous versions of the code focused on linkable libraries, because this
has unnecessary complexities, we plan to only support unified binaries.

Directory Structure
===============================================================================
ext - external sources required to build the code
src - source code for the development branch
legacy/libdissent - original, unmodified C++ version
legacy/py - original, unmodified Python version

Using
===============================================================================
Build the command-line (ConsoleApp):
qmake console.pro
make

The default configuration will create a local overlay with 10 members, to use
it execute:
./console ./conf/local.conf

This will launch a command-line interface, where commands can be typed.

Type help to print out the commands.

Network Use
===============================================================================
Inspect conf/slave_tcp.conf and conf/master_tcp.conf

Nodes using conf/master_tcp.conf are bootstrap peers
Nodes using conf/slave_tcp.conf should have bootstrap peers end points in
their remote_peers list

Binding to 0.0.0.0 will result in the first non-loop backdevice IP address
being used in exchanging IP address information.

After changing the configuration files and distributing the application,
begin by turning on the bootstrap peers first and then the client peers.
Afterward interaction is the same as discussed in the "Using" section.

Tests
===============================================================================
This suite contains many tests using googletest[1], use qmake on test.pro 
(qmake -makefile test.pro) to generate an appropriate makefile, which will
create a binary to test the code.

googletest was chosen because testing system code with QtTest would be quite
inefficient.
