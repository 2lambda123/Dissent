Anonymity
- The process for creating a session should be peers register, a leader not ready rejects, peers continue to register until successful, leader notifies all of starting
- Should keep a cache of closed sessions to respond to the remote peer that the session is dead and avoid race "wayward session messages"
- At a minimum each member of a group will have a signing key pair, where should this be stored
- Need some structure to communicate group status / change
- Make sessions optionally multithreaded, we really don't want crypto computation in the main thread
- Need some means to initiate a group / session

Connections
- ConnectionTable should be a value type
- ConnectionManager and maybe EL should turn reject requests for connections when closed

Transports
- EdgeListeners should produce QSharedPointer<Edge>
- CreateEdgeTo should also takes a callback so one can find out a connection attempted failed (better event driven system)

Utils
- VirtualTime should have a method that lets it be executed for a specific amount of time via QEvent mechanisms

Overlay
- When a node is stuck in bootstrapping mode, occassionally attempt to reconnect to the overlay
- A simple mechanism for bootstrapping all peers in a dissent system, should be this be flexible to support group creation?
- Implement Chord and use for overlay broadcasting and overall group dynamics

Cryptography
- Create a factory class for generating crypto objects so that we can easily switch between crypto libraries

Applications
- Create a compatibility API to support old applications
- Write a WEB Interface akin to the old GUI ... down with native Apps!

Overall
- Replace all pointers with qscoped / qshared pointers
- Consider removing qsharedata and replacing it with qsharedpointers
