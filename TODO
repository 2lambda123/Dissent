Anonymity
- Should keep a queue of ready messages for uninitialized leaders
- Should keep a cache of closed sessions to respond to the remote peer that the session is dead and avoid race "wayward session messages"
- At a minimum each member of a group will have a signing key pair, where should this be stored
- Need some structure to communicate group status / change

Connections
- ConnectionManager should send a Disconnect signal when it has safely disconnected after calling CM::Disconnect
- ConnectionTable should be a value type
- ConnectionManager and maybe EL should turn reject requests for connections when closed

Transports
- Need a real networking transport

Utils
- VirtualTime should have a method that lets it be executed for a specific amount of time via QEvent mechanisms

Overlay
- A simple mechanism for bootstrapping all peers in a dissent system, should be this be flexible to support group creation?

Cryptography
- Need comparison of existing security APIs
- Either a wrapper system for Qt or use QCA
- Signing, encryption / decryption using symmetric and asymmetric keys, and hashing algorithms
